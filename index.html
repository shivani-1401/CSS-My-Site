                <h3>Internet of Things</h3>
                <p>The idea of connecting things to the Internet and allowing them to interact with each other fascinated me a lot. I got the deeper knowledge about this field in my college with the help of hands on experience. I've used IBM Bluemix, Amazon AWS in my different projects.</p>

                <h3>Web Development</h3>
                <p>I always tried to escape from coding until 6th semester of B.Tech. After getting familiar with it, I actually developed interest in the field of Computer Science and I began my journey of coding with Java, then I learnt Python. I started learning Web Development few days back. This is my first website.</p>
